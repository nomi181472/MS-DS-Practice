    "#   This example shows how to use dlib's face recognition tool.  This tool maps\n",
    "#   an image of a human face to a 128 dimensional vector space where images of\n",
    "#   the same person are near to each other and images from different people are\n",
    "#   far apart.  Therefore, you can perform face recognition by mapping faces to\n",
    "#   the 128D space and then checking if their Euclidean distance is small\n",
    "#   enough. \n",
    "#\n",
    "#   When using a distance threshold of 0.6, the dlib model obtains an accuracy\n",
    "#   of 99.38% on the standard LFW face recognition benchmark, which is\n",
    "#   comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for face recognition as of\n",
    "#   February 2017. This accuracy means that, when presented with a pair of face\n",
    "#   images, the tool will correctly identify if the pair belongs to the same\n",
